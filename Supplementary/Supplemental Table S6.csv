AT5G26760,protein_coding,unknown protein; CONTAINS InterPro DOMAIN/s: Protein of unknown function DUF408 (InterPro:IPR007308)
AT5G46210 ,protein_coding,Arabidopsis CULLIN4 (CUL4) forms an E3 ubiquitin ligase with the CDD complex and a common catalytic subunit RBX1 in mediating light control of development. This CUL4-based E3 ligase is essential for the repression of photomorphogenesis. The partial loss of CUL4 function resulted in a constitutive photomorphogenic phenotype with respect to morphogenesis and light-regulated gene expression. CUL4 exhibits a synergistic genetic interaction with COP10 and DET1.
AT5G46630 ,protein_coding,"clathrin adaptor complexes medium subunit family protein, contains Pfam profile: PF00928 adaptor complexes medium subunit family; similar to micro-adaptins of clathrin coated vesicle adaptor complexes"
